api automation with karate framework
**OVERVIEW**
Here's an overview of the main features and aspects of the Karate framework:

- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Syntax:
Karate utilizes a simple and expressive syntax based on Gherkin (Given-When-Then) to define API tests. This approach makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical users, promoting collaboration and clear communication.

- Integration with Java:
Karate is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and integrates seamlessly with Java. It allows users to write Java code within their Karate tests when needed, providing the flexibility of using Java for complex operations.

- HTTP Request/Response Handling:
Karate supports easy creation and manipulation of HTTP requests and responses. It provides built-in methods to handle headers, payloads, cookies, authentication, and more.

- JSON and XML Handling:
Karate provides built-in support for working with JSON and XML data structures, making it convenient for testing RESTful APIs and SOAP services.

- Data-Driven Testing:
Karate allows for data-driven testing by enabling users to read data from external files (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) and use that data to drive their tests, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

- Parallel Execution:
The framework supports parallel execution of tests, which can significantly reduce the overall test execution time, making it suitable for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

- Assertions and Validations:
Karate offers powerful and expressive assertion capabilities, allowing users to validate API responses and behavior easily.

- Test Scenarios and Reusability:
Users can organize test scenarios into reusable modules, promoting modularity and code reusability across tests.

- Integrated Testing Environment:
Karate includes a built-in test runner, allowing users to run tests and generate reports without the need for additional setup or external tools.

- Mocking and Stubbing:
Karate provides the ability to create mocks and stubs for APIs, enabling testing of components in isolation.

- Parallel Execution:
The framework supports parallel execution of tests, which can improve test execution speed and efficiency.

**INSTALLATION**

- Java Installation:
Ensure you have Java installed on your system. Karate runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so having a compatible Java version is crucial. You can download Java from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK (https://openjdk.java.net/).

- Maven or Gradle Installation:
Karate can be integrated into your project using build tools like Maven or Gradle. Choose one of these build tools and ensure it's installed on your system. Follow the respective official documentation for installation:

- Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
- Gradle: https://gradle.org/install/
- Create a Maven or Gradle Project:
- Create a new Maven or Gradle project (or use an existing one) where you intend to use the Karate framework for testing.

- Add Karate Dependency:
Add the Karate dependency to your Maven pom.xml or Gradle build file to pull the Karate library into your project.
**MAVEN**
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.intuit.karate</groupId>
        <artifactId>karate-apache</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.1</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
- **GRADLE**
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.intuit.karate:karate-apache:1.0.1' // Use the latest version
}

- Build Your Project:
Build your project using Maven or Gradle to fetch the Karate dependency and set up the necessary project structure.

- Create Karate Feature Files:
Create Karate feature files with the .feature extension. These files contain your test scenarios written in Gherkin syntax.

- Run Karate Tests:
Use Maven or Gradle to run your Karate tests. Karate will execute the feature files and display the results.

**Data-Driven Testing**:

- Create a Feature File:
Create a .feature file in your Karate project. This file will contain the test scenario using the Scenario Outline.

- Define the Scenario Outline:
Define a scenario using the Scenario Outline keyword. This serves as a template for your test scenario with placeholders for variables.
Feature: Data-Driven Testing Example

- Scenario Outline: Verify API with Different Inputs
  Given path '/endpoint'
  And request <requestBody>
  When method POST
  Then status <expectedStatus>
  And match response == <expectedResponse>

  Examples:
    | requestBody        | expectedStatus | expectedResponse          |
    | { "value": "123" } | 200           | { "result": "success" }    |
    | { "value": "456" } | 404           | { "result": "not found" }  |

**Screenshot**
Once test cases run successfully, you will get html file under /target/karate-reports. open that html will into browser and you can see full reports of success/failed test cases with details logs.
I am adding below once sample screenshot for success test cases.
