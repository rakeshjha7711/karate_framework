# karate_framework

**Introduction**
This README provides a brief overview of using Karate for API automation. Karate is an open-source framework for API testing and automation that simplifies the process through its English-like language and ability to handle both HTTP and WebSockets.

**Key Features**
BDD Syntax: Karate uses Gherkin syntax, making it easy to write expressive and readable tests.

HTTP and RESTful API Automation: Karate supports HTTP request/response handling, making it suitable for RESTful API automation.

Assertions and Validations: Karate provides powerful and intuitive ways to validate responses and perform assertions.

Data-Driven Testing: Karate supports data-driven testing, allowing you to loop through data sets and perform tests accordingly.

**Parallel Execution**: Karate allows you to execute tests in parallel, speeding up the testing process.

**Prerequisites**

Java: Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. Download and install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit) from the official Oracle website.

Maven: Install Maven, a build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the project. Download it from the official Apache Maven website.

**Getting Started**
Create a Maven Project: Start by creating a new Maven project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

**Add Karate Dependency**: Add the Karate dependency to your pom.xml file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.karate</groupId>
    <artifactId>karate-apache</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version> <!-- Update to the latest version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


Create a Karate Test: Create a .feature file with your API tests using Gherkin syntax.

Run the Tests: Run the tests using Maven or your preferred build tool.

**Sample Karate Test** (example.feature)
Feature: Sample API Test

  Scenario: Verify API response
    Given url 'https://api.example.com/v1/users'
    When method GET
    Then status 200
    And match response == { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }

**Running the Tests**
Run the Karate tests using Maven:
mvn test
